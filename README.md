# Enish Menu & Admin Dashboard

A static multi-page menu experience for **Enish Restaurant & Lounge** paired with a modern admin dashboard that lets you review, edit, and export every menu section plus the weekly offers data.

## What this project includes

- **Customer-facing menus**: Seven themed HTML pages (Signature Cocktails, Classics, Spirits, Whisky & Cognac, Champagne & Wine, Beer & Aperitif, Miscellaneous) styled with `style.css` and progressively enhanced by `menu.js` and `offers.js`.
- **Weekly offers system**: `offers.json` feeds an offers modal, daily countdown, happy hour panel, and the floating "See Offers" trigger.
- **Admin dashboard**: `admin-dashboard.html` + `admin-dashboard.js` provide a GUI for editing menu items and offers, downloading updated HTML/JSON, and tracking unsaved changes.
- **Shared assets**: Brand imagery lives in `images/`.

## Quick start

1. Install a lightweight static server if you need one:
   ```bash
   npm install --global serve
   ```
2. From the project root, serve the site (both the public menus and the admin dashboard rely on HTTP fetch):
   ```bash
   serve .
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000/index.html` for the customer menu or `http://localhost:3000/admin-dashboard.html` for the admin experience.

> **Why a server?** Browser security blocks `fetch()` on `file://` URLs. Running through `http://localhost` unlocks the menu auto-loader, offers modal, and admin editor.

## Admin workflow

### Making Changes
1. Visit `/admin-dashboard.html` while the site is being served over HTTP.
2. Pick any menu page in the left navigation (or switch to Weekly Offers).
3. Edit names, descriptions, or prices inline. Add or remove items as needed.
4. The save bar will appear automatically when you make changes.

### Deploying Changes

1. Click **ðŸ“¦ Download Deployment Package** in the save bar.
2. This will download:
   - A complete instructions file (`enish-deployment-TIMESTAMP.txt`)
   - All changed files (HTML/JSON) ready to upload
3. Follow the step-by-step deployment instructions in the downloaded file.
4. Choose your preferred deployment method:
   - **GitHub Web UI**: Direct upload through browser (easiest)
   - **Git Command Line**: Use `git add`, `commit`, `push`
   - **GitHub Desktop**: Visual interface for committing changes

### Alternative: Single File Download

## Code commentary

Detailed, line-level descriptions for every source file live in [`docs/CODE_COMMENTARY.md`](docs/CODE_COMMENTARY.md). Each table links code lines to their runtime behavior, making it easy to understand or audit functionality without combing through raw source.

## Contributing

- Fork or branch from `main`.
- Run a local server for development so `fetch()`-based features work.
- Update `offers.json` through the admin dashboard to keep snapshots consistent.
- Keep accessibility in mind (semantic markup, focus states, ARIA labels).
